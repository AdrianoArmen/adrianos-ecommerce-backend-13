## Project Description 📋
This assignment was designed to showcase my knowledge of Object-Relational Mapping inside of our database. I build the back end of an E-commerce site configuring an [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) API that will allow us to use Sequelize to interact with the data inside our [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database. The walkthrough video above demonstrates how we can test the routes utilizing [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/products/insomnia) and their functionality to work with our data.

## Instructions 📦

Seed your data with the following command:


```bash
npm run seed
```
